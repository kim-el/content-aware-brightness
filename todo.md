fix commad t command w to start the trigger (like the trigger when switching windows, we shold have a fix term for this)
remember the time of day, if it late at night, use the user's preferece from before as based (default based is <50%>)
remember the ambience lighiting surrounding. but even if its late at night and the user preference it at 40% brigness, ambience will still win, because maybe the are in a dark place and need to lower the brigness more. or they are in brignt place and need to raise the brigness more.
